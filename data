# 20KOrchidbaits – bait sequences

This folder contains the FASTA sequences of the 20KOrchidbaits probe set.

- `nuclear_baits.fasta` – 20,000 nuclear bait sequences
- `plastid_baits.fasta` – 400 plastid bait sequences

Baits were designed from *Ophrys sphegodes* and *Phalaenopsis equestris*
reference genomes and transcripts using a sliding-window approach and
filtered for GC content, paralogy, and copy number.

These sequences correspond to the final bait set synthesized by
Daicel Arbor Biosciences.
