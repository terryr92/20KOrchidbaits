This repository contains all scripts, intermediate datasets, and derived resources used in the study:

## Repository 

Raw sequencing data are not stored in this repository and will be made available through public sequence archives.

---

## Bait

The 20KOrchidbaits set includes:
- 20,000 nuclear baits
- 400 plastid baits

---
# Supporting data

This file contains supporting datasets used to identify the subset of
20KOrchidbaits shared among orchid subfamilies.

Shared bait sets were defined through in silico capture simulations across
representatives of all five Orchidaceae subfamilies (sheet 1) and across
Catasetum species within Epidendroideae.

These datasets document the universal core of orchid baits consistently
recovered across major orchid lineages and support the comparative and
phylogenomic analyses presented in the study.
