## Repository structure

- `data/` – fasta file of nuclear and plastid baits
- `scripts/` – custom scripts used for analyses  
- `results/`

Raw sequencing data are not stored in this repository and will be made available through public sequence archives.

## Bait design

The 20KOrchidbaits set includes:
- 20,000 nuclear baits
- 400 plastid baits
